This is an eCommerse web app that I coded along the tutorial from Udemy.
Along this tutorial, I learned the frontend library React and the backend library Node.js
Also, I learned how to use some useful packages, such as axios, express, multer, react-bootstrap, react-router-dom and so on.
After deploying the app to Heroku, I started trying to add some features, fix some bugs or modify the code.
